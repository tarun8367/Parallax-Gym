      <h3>Benefits of Gym</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a gym membership or you're thinking about signing up for
        one, the most important thing to remember is that you have to use it.
        The advantages of gym workouts are that they provide several different
        ways to exercise, so going to the gym every day does not have to become
        boring and tedious.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
        recommends that adults get a minimum of 150 minutes a week of
        moderate-intensity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic
        activity. Plus, you should include two or more days of
        muscle-strengthening exercises that involve all major muscle groups.At
        first, this probably seems like a lot of exercise. However, if you
        spread those minutes out over the course of a week, you'll soon see just
        how easy it is to fit it in, especially if you're going to the gym every
        day.

      <h3>Explore the Gym</h3>
      <p>
        Gyms are now considered to be biggest craze for youth. The reason behind
        this is the smartness and aggression the youth needs. A healthy
        gymnastic body not only reflects a great personality but it also makes
        you stronger and keep fit. Gym activities keep you away from laziness
        makes you active and energetic whole day and enables you to perform
        various tasks. One of the most common mental benefits of exercise is
        stress relief. Working up a sweat can help manage physical and mental
        stress. Exercise also increases concentrations of norepinephrine, a
        chemical that can moderate the brain's response to stress. Exercise
        boosts energy. ... Regular physical activity can improve your muscle
        strength and boost your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and
        nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more
        efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more
        energy to tackle daily chores. The most common reason people start going
        to the gym and lifting weights is based on aesthetics. Most people want
        to improve some aspect of their appearance - lose weight, get "ripped"
        or "swole", have a bikini body... That's why people start, but most
        people give it up unless they have or develop a deeper motivation.

      <h3>More About Gym</h3>
      <p>
        Earlier it was believed that a healthy person is physically fit. This
        perception has changed, and now people believe that a healthy person is
        mentally and physically fit. Mental health and physical health can be
        inter-related in some cases. A relaxed mind can be achieved by
        meditating, and meditation, in turn, has a positive impact on physical
        health. It should be noted that physical health is not measured by the
        shape or size of a person. Even a thin person can be healthier than
        someone fatter. The metabolism of the body is largely responsible for
        our health and fitness. A better metabolism would mean faster absorption
        of nutrients into our bodies. While a slower metabolism would mean a
        slower absorption of food. A higher metabolism rate can be achieved by
        keeping the body healthy. This is possible when we start taking care of
        our nutrition. Healthy nutrition is not only rich in vegetables and
        fruits, but it is balanced and has a moderate amount of everything in a
        balanced proportion. The key to a healthy body starts with the art of
        balancing our intake and being aware of what harms us and what is good
        for us.
